/*
* This interface is written to overcome the limitation of live data postValue.
* When SDK pushes media events continuously then some events were getting lost.
* When post value gets trigger continuously then the latest value replaces the previous one and then the previous value doesn't reach to the UI observer.
* To overcome that limitation, the interface registration happens from UI and the all events now directly reaches to UI without any postValue.
